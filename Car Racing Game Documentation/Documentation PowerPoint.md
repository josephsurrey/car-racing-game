# Hints/Instructions

Please create as many extra slides as you need\. This template only contains enough slides to get you started\.

\<ctrl>\<m> makes a new slide

\<ctrl>\<d> duplicates a slide

You can move slides around by dragging and dropping on the left hand side of your screen\.

The instructions on each slide should be deleted when you have read them\.  Copies of the instructions are underneath the slides in the speaker notes \(just in case they are needed at a later stage\)\.

<span style="color:#ffffff"> __Please delete this slide when you no longer need it\!__ </span>

# Addressing Relevant Implications:

List and explain the Relevant implications here\.

Then as you develop your code\, come back and discuss how the implications have been addressed\. Insert additional slides as required\.

| Relevant Implication – say what this means… | Why this is relevant to my outcome… | How did you address this implication |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |

# Graphical User Interface - design:

_Create wireframes for your program’s GUI\.  Please place them on this slide\._

---


Create wireframes for your program’s GUI.  Please place them on this slide.


# Program Structure:

_Create a diagram showing your program’s structure and outline the classes and functions that you plan on developing\.  You are welcome to edit this slide once you start developing the outcome BUT when you do that\, you should show what has changed and explain why those changes were needed\._

Create a diagram showing your program’s structure and outline the classes and functions that you plan on developing.  You are welcome to edit this slide once you start developing the outcome BUT when you do that, you should show what has changed and explain why those changes were needed.


# Problem Decomposition:

__Provide evidence showing that you have decomposed the task\.  This can be in the form of a __  __trello__  __ screenshot or a list of components\.  If necessary\, you may revisit this slide and add to it or edit it as you create your outcome\.  When you make changes to this slide\, please date the changes and explain why they were made \(this can help provide evidence for M / E grades\)\.__

_Hint: Use the structure you developed earlier to work out what components you need\.  For each function\, you should have at least one component\. _

Provide evidence showing that you have decomposed the task.  This can be in the form of a trello screenshot or a list of components.  If necessary, you may revisit this slide and add to it / edit it as you create your outcome.  When you make changes to this slide, please do so in a different colour, date the changes and explain why they were made (this can help provide evidence for M / E grades).

Hint: Use the structure you developed earlier to work out what components you need.  For each function, you should have at least one component.

# Component development:

__Make as many copies of the next three slides as you need\.  For each component you should have…__

__A __  __T__  __rello screenshot / evidence of ongoing use of your project management techniques__

__A test plan for the component that has been created BEFORE you start coding\.  Your plan should allow you to test all logical pathways for this component\.  It should also include test cases for boundary and unexpected values\.__

__Screenshot evidence showing that you have worked through the test plan you developed\.__

_You should also provide evidence of trialling multiple components & techniques\.  Please make slides as needed for that evidence\._

Make as many copies of the next three slides as you need.  For each component you should have…
A Trello screenshot / evidence of ongoing use of your project management techniques
A test plan for the component that has been created BEFORE you start coding.  Your plan should allow you to test all logical pathways for this component.  It should also include test cases for boundary and unexpected values.
Screenshot evidence showing that you have worked through the test plan you developed.

You should also provide evidence of trialling multiple components & techniques.  Please make slides as needed for that evidence.


# 1 Component Planning:<Enter component name>

_How might your component work\.  This could be in the form of a Trello screenshot\._

---

Duplicate this slide and use it to show your planning for the current component.  This could be in the form of a Trello screenshot.


# 2 Component Test Plan: <Enter component name>

_Create a test plan for this component BEFORE you start coding\.  Your plan should allow you to test all logical pathways for this component\.  It should also include test cases for boundary and unexpected values\._

| __Test Cases \- input__ | __Expected output__ |
| :-: | :-: |
|  |  |

---

Create a test plan for this component BEFORE you start coding.  Your plan should allow you to test all logical pathways for this component.  It should also include test cases for boundary and unexpected values.



# 3 Evidence of testing:<Enter component name>

_Use this slide to provide evidence that you have tested your component in accordance with the test plan you developed earlier\._

---

Use this slide to provide evidence that you have tested your component in accordance with the test plan you developed earlier.


# Evidence of Trialling:<Enter component name>

_NOTE: Trialling needs to happen for _  _at least 2 _  _of your components but is not necessary for ALL components\._

_Trialling is not the same as testing\. Trialling is about finding different ways of building the same component\. Show evidence of  your trialling  here\. Select one of your trials for further development and give reasons for your choice\. _

NOTE: Trialling needs to happen for at least 2 of your components but is not necessary for ALL components.
Trialling is not the same as testing. Trialling is about finding different ways of building the same component. Show evidence of  your trialling  here. Select one of your trials for further development and give reasons for your choice. 

# Assembled Outcome Testing:

__Assemble your components into a working program\.  On the slides that follow\, please provide a test plan and evidence that your program works as expected\.__

__If you are going for M / E\, you also need to create extra slides showing how you have used your testing to improve the functionality of your program\.  This could mean having multiple test plans \(and screenshots\) showing several iterations of the assembled program\.__

---

Assemble your components into a working program.  On the slides that follow, please provide a test plan and evidence that your program works as expected.

If you are going for M / E, you also need to create extra slides showing how you have used your testing to improve the functionality of your program.  This could mean having multiple test plans (and screenshots) showing several iterations of the assembled program.


# 1 Assembled Outcome Testing – Test Plan

_Use this slide to provide a test plan for your complete program\.  You may wish to create multiple slides so that you can test for expected\, boundary and unexpected cases\.  _

_Remember to test ALL logical pathways so that you can ensure your program works correctly\._

---

Use this slide to provide a test plan for your complete program.  You may wish to create multiple slides so that you can test for expected, boundary and unexpected cases.  

Remember to test ALL logical pathways so that you can ensure your program works correctly.


# 2 Assembled Outcome Testing - Evidence

__Create as many slides as needed to provide evidence of testing that your outcome works for expected\, boundary and unexpected cases\.  __

---

Create as many slides as needed to provide evidence of testing that your outcome works for expected, boundary and unexpected cases.  


# Complex processes – Version control evidence

__Add screenshots of your GitHub repository – closely mirrored by a screenshot of your project folder on OneDrive __

# Complex processes - Discussion

__Discuss how you used \(and combined\) information gained from the planning\, testing and trialling of your components to improve the quality of your program\.  Note that synthesising information from planning\, testing and trialling of components and then discussing how this led to a high quality outcome is needed for an E grade\.__

Discuss how you used (and combined) information gained from the planning, testing and trialling of your components to improve the quality of your program.  Note that synthesising information from planning, testing and trialling of components and then discussing how this led to a high quality outcome is needed for an E grade.
